== Description ==

Add a Icon Font icon to your post with this awesome standalone custom meta-box.

Icon fonts gives you scalable vector icons that can instantly be customized â€” size, color, drop shadow, and anything that can be done with the power of CSS.

For developers it is easy to use the field in your theme. With the template functions `the_fa()` for echoing and `get_ga()` for returning the icon within the WordPress loop.

A handy Icon Font Meta Box shortcode is also included. Add an icon to your post by inserting `[fa icon="fa-gear"]`, where the attribute is the name of the Icon Font icon. You can also insert the current post icon by using the shortcode `[fa]`.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `icon-font-meta-box` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Select a field from the Icon Font meta box in your edit posts screen.
4. Place `<?php the_fa(); ?>` inside the WordPress loop in your templates.
5. Watch the magic happen.
