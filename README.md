### Description


Adds a icon font chooser to your post with this awesome standalone custom metabox.

Icon fonts gives you scalable vector icons that can instantly be customized â€” size, color, drop shadow, and anything that can be done with the power of CSS.

For developers it is easy to use the field in your theme. With the template functions `the_fa()` for echoing and `get_ga()` for returning the icon within the WordPress loop.

A handy Icon font shortcode is also included. Add an icon to your post by inserting `[fa icon="fa-gear"]`, where the attribute is the name of the icon font. You can also insert the current post icon by using the shortcode `[fa]`.

3. Select a field from the Font Awesome Field in your edit posts screen.
